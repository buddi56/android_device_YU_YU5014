If you started building TWRP/ROM then these instaructions are for you.

After repo initialization and before repo sync you have to add a file for syncing device tree and kernel source (TWRP). In case of ROM you have to add vendor tree also.

A. Instructions (after repo init):

1. cd <source_dir>

2. cd .repo/

3. mkdir local_manifests;

4. cd local_manifests;

5. nano roomservice.xml

Now a file has been created and you have include various trees for building. roomservice.xml will be like this.


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>

  <project name="buddi56/android_device_YU_YU5014" path="device/YU/YU5014" remote="github" revision="master" />
  ###<project name="buddi56/android_kernel_YU_YU5014" path="kernel/YU/YU5014" remote="github" revision="master" />###

</manifest>


As kernel source is not available I added hash. If kernel source is available then change the file accordingly. If kernel source is not available then remove 2nd line. Note: Using prebuilt kernels in building is deprecated.

Now perform 

repo sync -j(nproc --all) -c

All the sources along with your TWRP device tree and kernel source (if available) will; be downloaded.


B. Instructions (After repo sync):

After repo sync you have to tell buildbot to include your device for building TWRP. So for this you can either make a vendorsetup.sh file in your device tree or can edit the available file in TWRP source.

To edit vendorsetup.sh file in the downloaded TWRP source. Head to the below location.

1. cd <source_dir>/vendor/omni/

2. nano vendorsetup.sh

Now add below line at the end.

	add_lunch_combo omni_YU5014-eng

3. Save file and exit.

You can also choose user or userdbug. But they are not required for TWRP.


##Now start the build process using the command given in README.md
